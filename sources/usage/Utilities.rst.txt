Various utility scripts / functions
=====================================

1. generating contact matrices of different resolution (bin size) 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The script **ContactMatDiffRes.sh** within the folder **Imp_Scripts** generates contact matrix of desired bin size given a valid pairs file generated from the HiC-pro pipeline. Parameters associated with this script is:

	-V ValidPairsFile 		Name of the valid pairs file generated from the HiC-pro pipeline
	
	-B BinSize 				Size of the bin (in bytes: target resolution): default 5000 (5 Kb)

	-C ChrSizeFile 			File containing the size of the chromosomes corresponding to the reference genome 
							(such as hg19.chrom.sizes)
	
	-D OutDir 				Output directory which will contain the contact matrix of the target resolution
	
	-H HiCProDir 			Directory containing the HiC-pro installed package.

A folder **HiCPro_Matrix_BinSize${BinSize}** will be created under the specified output directory. The bin specific 
interval file name is **MatrixHiCPro_abs.bed** and the corresponding contact matrix file name is **MatrixHiCPro.matrix**


2. inferring peaks from HiChIP data (for use in the HiChIP pipeline)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The script **PeakInferHiChIP.sh** within the folder **Imp_Scripts** is used to infer peaks from HiChIP data. The script can be used if HiC-pro pipeline is already executed on a given pair of reads (such as .fastq.gz read pairs). The script uses **MACS2* package for inferring the peaks. Parameters associated with this script are as follows:

	-H HiCProDir		Directory containing the reads generated by HiC-pro pipeline. 
						Within this directory, files of the formats .ValidPairs, .DEPairs, .REPairs, and .SCPairs 
						are present, which corresponds to different categories of reads generated by the HiC-pro pipeline.

	-D OutDir			Directory to contain the output set of peaks. Default: current directory
	
	-R refGenomeStr		Reference genome specific string used for MACS2. Default is 'hs' for human chromosome. 
						For mouse, specify 'mm'.
	
	-M MACS2ParamStr	String depicting the parameters for MACS2. Default: "--nomodel --extsize 147 -q 0.01"
	
	-L ReadLength		Length of reads for the HiC-pro generated reads. Default 75

The script uses all of the DE, SC, RE and validpairs reads generated from the HiC-pro pipeline to infer peaks. 
The folder **MACS2_ExtSize** within the specified output directory contains the MACS2 generated peaks.


3. merging a set of ChIP-seq alignment files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The script **MergeBAMInferPeak.sh** within the folder **Imp_Scripts** processes a set of ChIP-seq alignment files, to generate a merged alignment, infer peak (using MACS2) from the generated alignment, and also determines the coverage of individual bins (according to a specified fixed bin size) with respect to individual input ChIP-seq alignment files. Output of this script is used as an input to the differential analysis module (mentioned next). Parameters associated with this script are as follows:

	-I InpFile			A list of ChIP-seq BAM files. Multiple BAM files are to be mentioned in the 
						format: -I bamfile1.bam -I bamfile2.bam -I bamfile3.bam and so on
	
	-D OutBaseDir 		Directory containing the output set of peaks. Default: current directory
	
	-R refGenome 		Reference genome string used for MACS2. Default is 'hs' for human chromosome. For mouse, specify 'mm'
	
	-M MACS2ParamStr 	String depicting the parameters for MACS2. Default: "--nomodel --extsize 147 -q 0.01"
	
	-C ChrSizeFile 		Filename containing the chromosome size information for the reference genome
	
	-b BinSize         	BinSize in base pair. Used to compute the ChIP-seq coverage for individual input 
						BAM files. Default = 5000 (means 5 Kb)

Output files generated from this script:
	
	1. ${OutBaseDir}/merged_input.bam: merged ChIP-seq alignment file

	2. ${OutBaseDir}/MACS2_Out/out.macs2_peaks.narrowPeak: Peak (derived by MACS2) file generated by merged ChIP-seq alignment.
	
	3. ${OutBaseDir}/ChIPCoverage1.bed, ${OutBaseDir}/ChIPCoverage2.bed, ..., ${OutBaseDir}/ChIPCoverageN.bed, 
	
		where N is the number of input ChIP-seq alignment files. Each of these output files contain the coverage of corresponding input alignment file (with respect to the specified bin size).


4. Producing FitHiChIP loops with different FDR thresholds
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is useful to obtain significant loops on different FDR threholds, without running the complete FitHiChIP module with different FDR threshold parameters. 

For a custom FDR threshold of 0.05, first user should apply the following awk script on the file PREFIX.interactions_FitHiC.bed (mentioned in section 4.1.4, file no C):

	.. note::

		awk '((NR==1) || ($NF<0.05))' ${PREFIX}.interactions_FitHiC.bed > ${PREFIX}.interactions_FitHiC_Q0.05.bed



5. Applying merge filtering on any set of significant loops (generated by FitHiChIP or any other loop calling method)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is useful to apply the merge filtering on any set of significant loops, not just of FitHiChIP.

Assuming the source code of FitHiChIP is placed within the folder ${CodeDir}, user can merge the adjacent loops using the following command:

	.. note::

		python ${CodeDir}/src/CombineNearbyInteraction.py --InpFile ${PREFIX}.interactions_FitHiC_Q0.05.bed --OutFile ${PREFIX}.interactions_FitHiC_Q0.05_MergeNearContacts.bed --headerInp 1 --binsize 5000 --percent 100 --Neigh 2

	where, the options are:

		--InpFile InpFile 		Input file containing FitHiChIP significant interactions.
		--OutFile OutFile		Output file to contain the significant and merge filtered loops.
		--headerInp Header 		Boolean value (0/1): 1 means InpFile has header line. 0 means no header line is in the 
								input loop file.
		--binsize BinSize 		Bin size (in bp). For example, 5000 means 5 Kb bin size.
		--percent PctVal		% of significant loops considered for merge filtering (default PctVal = 100). 
								Users are advised to keep this value.
		--Neigh Val 			Window size (number of bins) for merge filtering. Default is Val = 2, means 
								2X2 bins are employed as window. Users are advised to keep this value.


The file ${PREFIX}.interactions_FitHiC_Q0.05_MergeNearContacts.bed is the set of loops generated after merging adjacent ones.
